The project undertook as my capstone project will be investigating the relationship between energy and mining consumption in Nairobi, Kenya and how it affects climate change. Analysis will be briefly global (Africa) before focusing specifically on Kenya.
The six steps that this project followed are:
•	Context & Problem Identification
•	Data Wrangling
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Pre-Processing and Training Data Development
•	Modeling

Context
Climate risks pose serious threats to Kenya’s sustainable development goals. With the largest economy in East Africa and a population of 48.5 million, Kenya serves as the regions financial, trade and communications hub.
The country’s economy is largely dependent on rainfed agriculture and tourism, each susceptible to climate variability and change and extreme weather events. Increasing interseason variability, increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall events and sea level rise lead to severe crop and livestock losses, famine and displacement. High population growth in urban areas is leading to expanding informal settlements, which are at risk from water scarcity, flooding and heat.
Most of the country’s coast is low-lying, with coastal plains, islands, beaches, wetlands and estuaries at risk from sea level rise. A sea level rise of 30cm is estimated to threaten 17 percent (4,600 hectares) of Mombasa with inundation. Models estimate that by 2030 climate variability and extremes will lead to losses equivalent to 2.6 percent of GDP annually.
Kenya’s geography is dominated by arid and semi-arid plains, with a temperate highland plateau (reaching over 5,000 m) in the center, and a hotter, wetter climate along the coast and the shores of Lake Victoria. Two-thirds of the country receive less than 500 mm (19.6 in) of rainfall per year; coastal and highland areas receive annual averages upwards of 1,100 mm (43 in) and 2,000 mm (78 in), respectively. 
Kenya has two rainy seasons: “long rains” from March to June (about 70 percent of total annual rainfall); and “short rains” from October to December. In the west and along the coast, additional significant rainfall occurs outside of these two rainy seasons. Temperatures range from an average of 18°C (64 DegF) in high elevation areas like Nairobi to 26°C (78.8 DegF) in coastal areas such as Mombasa. 
Located on the equator, Kenya experiences little seasonal temperature variation.

Problem Identification
Stemming from different sources from the World Bank Open Data (WBOD), the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDE) and Meteo Blue (meteorological service created at the University of Basel, Switzerland in 2006), several climate-related data were collected to extract insights into possible correlations between causes and consequences of climate change in Kenya. 20+ years of daily data were analyzed and, using machine learning, a prediction of main climate consequences was simulated up until 2030.
